# NES-CareerAI

Hi there! One project I've been working on is NES-CareerAI, a smart career advice tool.

It basically proposes a few potential career choices depending on a skill (like “drawing” or perhaps “drawing cartoons”). Imagine it as a personal career counselor who really *listens* to what you're good at or enjoy doing.
It's main target is students from classes 10-12.(that according to me is the most confusing state in terms of career , at least for me:)

This AI's brain is a sentence transformation model that lets it grasp the meaning behind the skill you're inputting, essentially words. It next searches for the most close or nearest sense-making employment utilizing a vast database I like to call the *KareerAIdataset* (based on the ESCO occupations dataset—really named *Karrierewege*, which translates in German as *career pathways— quite cool, right? ).

## !!please refer to setup_instructions.md file is you wish to try this project for yourself!!

# 🔍 What it does

- You type a skill—such as "public speaking. "
- The model locates the most semantically comparable career options.
- You receive three career recommendations best fit your input.

Why I built this

At my school we have this great career counseling festival called Future Next. I was totally astonished last year when I was in class 12. The entire event felt very well considered as they passed around these booklets with career alternatives, study pathways, and future prospects. And deep down, I could see some tech—presumably AI or machine learning - powering much of it.

All of that experience impacted me.

A few months afterward, during a casual talk, my father remarked, "Why not try creating something like that yourself? " And I was like yep, why not? That one phrase really ignited this entire effort.

Made from scratch as a noob, with a lot of learning, trial-and-error, and probably more late nights than I would want to admit, this is my interpretation of that idea. But here it is. My effort at constructing a little piece of the future.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- MPNet-based Sentence Transformers
- Pandas and NumPy
- Flask (for the web app portion, which I am now developing)
- local machine testing with Google Colab: took a lot of time 😅

# 📈 Future direction

Add a web interface to make use simpler.
- Speed for slower computers will be improved.
- Perhaps include career data (like salary, growth, etc. ).
